# Creating PWA Icons

You need to create two icon files:
- icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

## Quick Options:

1. **Use an online tool**: 
   - Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
   - Upload a logo/image
   - Download the generated icons

2. **Use the SVG placeholder**:
   - Open icon-placeholder.svg in a browser or image editor
   - Export as PNG at 192x192 and 512x512 sizes

3. **Create manually**:
   - Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.)
   - Create a square image with your logo/brand
   - Export as PNG at the required sizes

For now, the app will work without icons, but they're needed for the full PWA experience.
